### ionic
Ionic focuses on the frontend UX and UI interaction of an app â€” UI controls, interactions, gestures, animations. It's easy to learn, and integrates with other libraries or frameworks, such as Angular, React, or Vue. Alternatively, it can be used standalone without any frontend framework using a simple script include.
